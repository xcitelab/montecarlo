## User Code for MC applications

Who are we? Why don't I copy paste a snippet from Magdalena's website:

Welcome to the <strike>website</strike> __github repo__ of the X-ray Cancer Imaging and Therapy Experimental (XCITE) Lab at the University of Victoria. We investigate novel x-ray imaging modalities and x-ray radiation therapy techniques. The goal of our research is threefold. First, we aim to improve cancer detection by proposing and thoroughly investigating emerging diagnostic x-ray imaging modalities. Second, we plan on improving outcomes of cancer radiation treatments by combining nanoparticle therapy and radiotherapy. Third, we strive to decrease the cost of radiation therapy by designing an economical radiotherapy source capable of treatments of a broad range of cancers.
